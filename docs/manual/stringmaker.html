<h1 id="stringmaker">StringMaker</h1>

<p>You may be well aware that string manipulation in C# can end up allocating a lot of memory for the garbage collector to clean up later. You may even have used the StringBuilder class to mitigate this concern, but did you know that StringBuilder also generates a lot of garbage memory? That's why Switchboard includes a class called StringMaker, which is intended as a more efficient replacement for StringBuilder.</p>
<p>As I was working on dependency injection it seemed logical to implement a logger service. A logger is maybe the most obvious example of a service that a dependency injector may provide, and I had a need for persistent log files. My dissatisfaction with other solutions lead me perpetually down one rabbit hole after another as I found myself wanting to improve on whatever I saw. I didn't want to accept that I would have to potentially allocate garbage memory, without being fully aware of it, just to write log files. So, to make a long story short, Switchboard is now able to concatenate any string you can imagine and write it as UTF-8 bytes in a text file without ever allocating any unnecessary memory for garbage collection.</p>
<p>How do I avoid garbage collection entirely? Well, the same way anyone does, with memory pooling. When memory is needed, it is indeed allocated, but then when it is no longer needed it is always cached away for later use. Does that lead to a bunch of bloated memory pools instead of garbage collection? Hopefully, after reading the sections on Collections and Memory Management, you will agree that it is indeed a good solution. If you don't want to use memory pooling at all, every memory pool in this framework can have its max count set to 0, and garbage collection will function as normal.</p>
<p>So, back to StringBuilder. StringBuilder is supposed to get rid of garbage memory allocation when working with strings, right? Wrong. StringBuilder allocates new memory that must be garbage collected during many of its operations. First of all, appending any kind of number variable is going to result in a call to the ToString() method. That method is allocating a new garbage string every time. So, if you're trying to eliminate garbage collection by using StringBuilder, I hope you don't want to append the value of any number variables to your strings. Secondly, StringBuilder allocates new character arrays internally in chunks as needed. That may not seem like an issue, and it's not. However, if you append a lot of characters, resulting in multiple chunks being allocated, and then set the Length to 0, guess what happens? A brand new array of characters is allocated. The length of the new array is equal to the entire capacity of all chunks that were previously allocated. All of the old chunks are then discarded for garbage collection. I bet you didn't assume that would happen from something like StringBuilder.Length = 0. StringBuilder doesn't really know how to reduce its Length beyond the boundary of the current chunk without allocating garbage memory.</p>
<p>So, I created StringMaker as an alternative. Neither StringBuilder nor StringMaker are implemented as an interface. They are both tightly coupled, strong dependencies no matter which one you use. However, I designed StringMaker to have a functional interface, the signature of the methods and properties, that would closely align with StringBuilder. That way you can do a find and replace operation to replace either one with the other, and most of the methods should still function as expected. However, there are some methods I did not replicate in StringMaker because I view them as unnecessary or inherently costly operations, and StringMaker includes some methods that StringBuilder does not.</p>
