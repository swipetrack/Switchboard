<h2 id="core-logger">Core Logger</h2>

<p>One of Switchboard's primary features is logger implementation that writes persistent log files to disk, on any hardware platform, with minimal impact on performance. Most of the logger module is in the Core library, which has no dependencies on Unity. Switchboard's logger interface and log file writer can be used in any C# application. One caveat is that the LogFileWriter class is designed for a loop based system, as is the case in game development. When a log entry is sent to LogFileWriter, it is formatted and added to a queue of entries that will be flushed to disk later. This design decouples the log call from the more costly process of opening a file stream and flushing the appropriate bytes to the disk. Therefore, at some later point LogFileWriter.FlushLogs() must be called. In Switchboard's standard use case, this method is called at the end of each frame. In your application you may call this method wherever it seems most appropriate. However, if logs are not flushed regularly, it becomes possible for many logs to build up in the queue, which could cause flushing to take longer.</p>
<p>Opening the file stream is a costly operation. Switchboard, by default, opens the file stream and keeps it open for the duration of the application. LogFileWriter.OpenNewFile() or .Open() will open the file stream, creating a new file if necessary, and keep it open until .Close() is called. Flushing logs will open the file stream if it is not open already.</p>
<p>The Switchboard logger implements an ILogger interface that, while not identical to, is intended to be essentially interchangeable with the standard .NET ILogger interface. Unity also has an ILogger interface. So, it will often be necessary to define an alias using ILogger = Switchboard.ILogger. This can be defined as a global using statement. The core implementation of this interface is LoggerRoot which maintains an array of other ILogger implementations, and calls the appropriate log method on each one. I call these log targets, but they have no special definition because they are just further implementations of the ILogger interface. So, in the typical case, the main logger instance is a LoggerRoot with a LogFileWriter, and potentially other log targets. However, you can use the LogFileWriter class directly if you like.</p>
<h2 id="unity-logger">Unity Logger</h2>
<p>In Unity, Switchboard also includes an implementation of ILogger that writes to Unity's default logger. This can be assigned to the LoggerRoot as an additional target. Also, I use an implementation of Unity's ILogHandler called UnityLogHijacker to re-route Debug.Log() calls so they are sent to the LoggerRoot instead. The static Logger class provides a LoggerRoot instance, and simple methods for hijacking Debug.Log() calls, and for adding Unity's logger to the LoggerRoot as a target. The LogFileManager class is intended to simplify many of the manual operations around handling log files within Unity. Also, when you start a log file with LogFileManager you'll get a detailed report of the current hardware platform statistics, including things like &quot;Graphics Tier&quot; which can really help when configuring your project settings.</p>
