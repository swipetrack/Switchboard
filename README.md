# Switchboard
Switchboard is a framework for Unity providing a composition root, dependency injection, and the ability to update plain C# objects. The core C# module provides a logger with high performance log files, a better alternative to StringBuilder, and methods for converting variables to strings of characters without allocating garbage memory.
